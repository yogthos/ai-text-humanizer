EXAMPLES:
BAD: Original 'The cat sat' → Generated 'Einstein's cat sat in New York' (WRONG - added entities)
GOOD: Original 'The cat sat' → Generated 'The feline rested' (CORRECT - preserved meaning, changed style)

STRUCTURE MATCHING EXAMPLES:
If Reference has: 'The process—complex and dangerous—requires care.'
Your output MUST include dashes: 'The method—intricate and risky—demands attention.'

If Reference has: 'First, we observe; then, we analyze; finally, we conclude.'
Your output MUST use semicolons: 'First, we see; then, we study; finally, we decide.'

If Reference is 35 words with 3 clauses, your output must be ~35 words with 3 clauses too.
